**INTRODUCTION**
A company specializing in B2C sales (product: Data Science and Data Engineering related courses) spends significant money on marketing campaigns across various channels such as social media, email, and search advertising. More information on marketing sources can be found in the data column “Marketing Source”. The marketing team faces challenges in optimizing the marketing budget allocation across these channels to maximize revenue and return on investment (ROI).

This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to optimize the marketing budget allocation across various channels to maximize revenue and ROI. By using machine learning algorithms, the marketing team can make informed decisions about allocating the marketing budget based on predicted revenue and ROI.

Steps in developing the Model
- Data Exploration: This is where i studied the data,checked for missing data, categorical data etc.
- Data Preprocessing: This built a foundation on the data knowledge from Data exploration in sorting data, encoding categorical data, and preparing data from model development
- Model building: The model was developed using three algorithm; Random forest classifier, Xgboost classifier, and LightGBM algorithm
- Model testing: The model was tested on test data
- Model evaluation
  Conclusion: Given the Precision-Recall curve(PR curve) of the three model, LightGBM model gave the best performance, this is because it produced higher Precision-Recall value unlike the other two algorithm.
